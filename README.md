## Coding Exercise

### Requirements
You are given a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In your favorite programming language, write a command-line program that takes one command-line argument (a number) and determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all combinations x and y, where x and y are all prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument.  Describe how to run your examples. Please generate the list of primes without using built-in functionality.

### Instructions
At the command prompt enter 'php', then the name of the script 'exercise.php', then a single integer. Example: `php exercise.php 15`

### Expected Results
Upon completion of the script you will be advised if the secret function selected was additive or not additive.
